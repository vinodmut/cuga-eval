"""Pin how the external agent adapters reach AppWorld tools against how CUGA does.

    LangChain adapters share CUGA's tool-provider code. Native Hermes instead
    reaches the same AppWorld API surface through AppWorld's MCP server. These
    tests pin the LangChain path; Hermes's separate boundary is tested in
    ``test_agent_adapters.py``.

Deliberately no registry here: every provider is a stub. These tests are about
which calls each path makes, not about what a live registry returns.
