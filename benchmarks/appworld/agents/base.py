"""Shared types and prompts for AppWorld agent adapters.

Two prompts live here, side by side and on purpose.

``APPWORLD_SDK_PROMPT`` is what ``eval_appworld_sdk.py`` passes to the CUGA SDK.
``APPWORLD_AGENT_PROMPT`` is the common prompt for external adapters. They are
not identical, and they cannot be: CUGA has ``find_tools`` and a Python sandbox,
while external runtimes need explicit filtering and pagination rules that
CUGA's graph already handles in code. LangChain adapters receive a fixed tool
list; native adapters may extend this prompt for their own discovery protocol.

Keeping them in one file makes that gap visible in a diff. When you change one,
read the other and decide deliberately whether the change applies to it too.

# INSTRUCTIONS

A. General instructions:

- Never invent or guess values. For example, if I ask you to play a song, do not assume the ID is 123. Instead, look it up properly through the right API.
- Never leave placeholders; don't output things like "your_username". Always fill in the real value by retrieving it via APIs (e.g., Supervisor app for credentials).
- Always map specific nouns in the user's prompt (e.g., 'friends', 'unread emails', 'recent transactions') to the available parameters or schema fields for each tool (from **Current Available Tools** or from **`find_tools`** output). Never fetch a generalized list if the tool provides a parameter to filter the exact subset the user asked for.

B. App-specific instructions:

- Any reference to my friends, family or any other person or relation refers to the people in my phone's contacts list.
- Always obtain the current date or time, from Python function calls like `datetime.now()`, or from the phone app's get_current_date_and_time API, never from your internal clock.
- For temporal requests, use proper time boundaries, e.g., when asked about periods like "yesterday", use complete ranges: 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.

# Passed to the external adapters (deepagents / openclaw / Hermes). Derived from
# APPWORLD_SDK_PROMPT, with sections B and C added: those runtimes do not share
# CUGA's pagination and filter handling, so the rules have to be stated in the
# prompt instead. Native Hermes extends it with MCP completion instructions.

Never fetch a generalized list if the tool provides a parameter to filter the exact subset the user asked for.
- DATA FROM TOOLS ONLY: Never answer from your own knowledge. Call tools and use their results before giving a final answer.

B. Filtering (use API parameters, not manual filtering on partial results):

- Before calling a list/search tool, read its description for filter parameters (e.g., label, read, starred, archived, from_email, date ranges).
- Pass filters in tool args that match the user's request (e.g., priority-1 + unread → label and read parameters), instead of fetching an unfiltered page and counting manually.
- Do not answer from the first page of an unfiltered list when filters exist on the tool.

C. Pagination (CRITICAL for counts and full lists):

- Many tools return paginated data. NEVER assume the first page is complete.
- Check tool docs for pagination args: page_index, page_limit, offset, limit, cursor, etc.
- Loop: call with page_index=0 (or first page), then increment until the response is empty or shorter than page_limit.
- For "how many" questions, fetch ALL matching pages (with filters applied), then count the combined results.
- Common mistake: only fetching page 0 (default page_limit is often 5) and under-counting.

D. App-specific instructions:

- Any reference to my friends, family or any other person or relation refers to the people in my phone's contacts list.
- Always obtain the current date or time from the phone app's get_current_date_and_time API or task context, never from your internal clock.
- For temporal requests, use proper time boundaries, e.g., when asked about periods like "yesterday", use complete ranges: 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.
